# manga-projects
This is a repository for Priyam's side projects focusing on manga. Manga and anime have captivated me since childhood. 

Around the time I fell into the machine learning rabbit hole, I began to appreciate Hirohito Araki's manga. The first project so far is a Jojo's character classifier, specifically for part 4. Based on VGG19 and implemented in Keras, this classifier identifies one of six main characters from a manga image. This classifier loads images (100x100 labelled XXXX.png) and a CSV file that contains labels (in format XXXX,Y).
